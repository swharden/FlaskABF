# FlaskABF
FlaskABF is a Python-based web application designed to browse and analyze electrophysiology data stored as Axon Binary Format (ABF) files. 

This project reads ABF files using [pyABF](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF) (and [pyABFauto](https://github.com/swharden/pyABFauto)) and displays them using a Flask server. Web interfaces are inspired by abandonware like [SWHLab](https://github.com/swharden/SWHLab) and [SWHLabPHP](https://github.com/swharden/SWHLabPHP). FlaskABF is built on the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org) and is intended to be easier to maintain and develop for than complex systems based on custom configurations of Apache and PHP.
